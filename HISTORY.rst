History/Changelog
=================

1.7.0
-----

- Add ``--property-decorators`` option.

1.6.0
-----

- Fix ``--ignore-noqa`` by disabling ``pydocstyle``'s ``noqa`` handling.

1.5.0
-----

- Add ``--ignore-decorators`` option which allows functions with a specific
  decorator to ignore error codes.

1.4.0
-----

- Add ``--docstring-convention`` option which allows selection of conventions
  besides the default ``pep257``.  Available options are based on those
  available from ``pydocstyle`` and are currently ``pep257``, ``google``, and
  ``numpy``.  ``flake8-docstrings`` also adds a special ``all`` docstring
  convention which will enable all rules from ``pydocstyle``.  Note that
  ``pydocstyle`` defines some conflicting rules so you'll want to use
  ``ignore`` / ``extend-ignore`` when selecting ``docstring-convention = all``

- Bump minimum flake8 version to 3

- Fix proper handling of ``stdin`` via ``--stdin-display-name``

1.3.1
-----

- Fix incompatibility with pydocstyle 4.x

1.3.0
-----

- Bump minimum pydocstyle version to 2.1.0

1.2.0
-----

- Fix EnvironError and AllError invocations

1.1.0
-----

- Upgrade dependency on pydocstyle to 2.0.0

1.0.3
-----

- Use flake8-polyfill to get standard-in to handle Flake8 3.x and 2.x

1.0.2
-----

- Use pycodestyle to get standard-in.

1.0.1
-----

- Make sure this works out of the box (is enabled by default) with Flake8 3.0

1.0.0
-----

- Switch dependency name to pydocstyle. pep257 was renamed to pydocstyle, this
  update switches the requirement to that new package name. Since we're
  swapping out dependencies, we've issued a major version bump.

0.2.7
-----

- Try to import pydocstyle (not pycodestyle) as pep257

0.2.6
-----

- Respect pep257's default ignore list

- Handle AllError and other exceptions from pep257

0.2.5
-----

- Use pep257's ``tokenize_open`` function to pass input to the tool.

- Use pep257's conventions so any error codes that are ignored by default
  using ``pep257`` are also ignored by default with this plugin.

0.2.4
-----

- Fix bug introduced in 0.2.2 where the file source was always None causing
  D100 and D104 errors for all files and no other errors to be found.

0.2.3
-----

- Remove extraneous space in error message.

- Fix up how the plugin displays with ``flake8 --version``.

0.2.2
-----

- Better support for input provided via stdin.

-----

- Prevent AllError or EnvironmentErrors from being raised. Thanks Alex
  Pyrgiotis.
